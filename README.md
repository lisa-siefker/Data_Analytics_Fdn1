This project analyzes the Kaggle “Airbnb in NYC” dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vrindakallu/new-york-dataset). 
The dataset summarizes Airbnb listing activity in New York City as of January 5, 2024. 
There are 20,759 rows of data. 
The project analyzed the following key variables to answer the question: Which Airbnb is the best deal (i.e., the rating is above average and lowest price) in each neighborhood? 

• Neighborhood Group (5 unique groups) 
• Neighborhood (219 unique neighborhoods) 
• Type of Listing (e.g., private/shared room) 
• Price per night • Minimum Nights (minimum nights required for a reservation) 
• Number of Reviews (total number of reviews) 
• Availability_365 (number of days listing is available each year) 
• Rating (average total rating) 
• Number of Bedrooms • Number of Beds • Number of Bathrooms

METHODOLOGY: 
1. Clean and tidy data
2. Review the data structure and determine whether any variables need to be converted to a different data type
3. Remove variables that aren’t relevant to the analysis to remove clutter from the output
4. Filter data to remove rows that don’t meet criteria
5. Explore and analyze ratings, price and neighborhood information using tables, histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, and statistical summary data to determine which Airbnbs are the best deal in each neighborhood.
