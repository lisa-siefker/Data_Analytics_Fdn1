## Background
Project 1 analyzes the Kaggle “Airbnb in NYC” dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vrindakallu/new-york-dataset). 
The dataset summarizes Airbnb listing activity for 20,759 Airbnbs in New York City as of January 5, 2024. 
The project analyzed the following key variables to answer the question: Which Airbnb is the best deal (i.e., the rating is above average and lowest price) in each neighborhood? <br>

• Neighborhood Group (5 unique groups) <br>
• Neighborhood (219 unique neighborhoods) <br>
• Type of Listing (e.g., private/shared room) <br>
• Price per night • Minimum Nights (minimum nights required for a reservation) <br>
• Number of Reviews (total number of reviews) <br>
• Availability_365 (number of days listing is available each year) <br>
• Rating (average total rating) <br>
• Number of Bedrooms • Number of Beds • Number of Bathrooms<br>

## Methodology <br>
1. Clean and tidy data <br>
2. Review the data structure and determine whether any variables need to be converted to a different data type <br>
3. Remove variables that aren’t relevant to the analysis to remove clutter from the output <br>
4. Filter data to remove rows that don’t meet criteria <br>
5. Explore and analyze ratings, price and neighborhood information using tables, histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, and statistical summary data to determine which Airbnbs are the best deal in each neighborhood.

## Statistical Analysis <br>
In Project 2, a staistical consultant answered the following research questions regarding the Airbnb data set: <br>

1. Can you predict an Airbnb rating based on price per night and neighborhood/borough? <br>
2. Can you predict the price per night of an Airbnb based on neighborhood/borough and number of bedrooms? <br>
3. Is there a significant difference in average price between Manhattan and Brooklyn Airbnbs that have 2 bedrooms and 1 bathroom? <br>
4. Is there a significant difference in average price between Airbnbs that have average reviews that are more than four stars and Airbnbs that have average reviews that are less than 4 stars? <br>

The Project 2 research paper summarizes the consultant's statistical analysis and answers to the research questions.
