# METHODOLOGY: <br>
1. Clean and tidy data <br>
2. Review the data structure and determine whether any variables need to be converted to a different data type <br>
3. Remove variables that aren’t relevant to the analysis to remove clutter from the output <br>
4. Filter data to remove rows that don’t meet criteria <br>
5. Explore and analyze ratings, price and neighborhood information using tables, histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, and statistical summary data to determine which Airbnbs are the best deal in each neighborhood.
